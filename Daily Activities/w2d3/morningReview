first kind declaration

anonymous function - taking function object and assigning to variable

secondKind(); - paran runs the function

callback function is still anonymous

app.get('/', function(req,res,index) {
  res.render(index)
})

is equal to

app.get('/', (req,res,index) => {
  ('also_index')
})

objects as dictionaries

building a tool kit within an object

telling JS look up the dictionary

params are for data outside the function and you need it inside the function

assume functions are blind and oblivious to outside the world and they tend to look only within themselves

calling returns
